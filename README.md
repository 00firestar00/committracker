# Commit Tracker

A simple project for tracking commits per day based on a list of users

Modify `users.conf` with a list of users you want to track.

Tracks number of PushEvents with commits for the current day.
This is similar to the contributions graph GitHub provides, but there may be some differences in how they are counted.
